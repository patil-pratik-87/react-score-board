This app will give you the batting averages for Sachin Tendulkar against different countries in the past year.

#Installation
    npm install

#Deployement    
use npm run start --> To run the local server and open http://localhost:3000.

#Dependencies
1. Material UI React --> This is used for getting UI controls since the application could scale further.
2. Used SCSS/SASS to provide structure and advanced features to the CSS.
3. Used Typescript for type safety.
4. Used Redux Thunk.

#How does it work?
1.  Select countries form the drop down and bar will depict the batting average with the precise number.

#Support
1. This app has a responsive design.
2. This app supports in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

#Issues
We are facing a CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) issue with the API used to fetch the data, which needs to be tackled at the server end.
Although this does not break the app completely, still something to be aware of.
